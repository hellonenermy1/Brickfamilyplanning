# Brick V1 Phase 8D — Permanent findings ledger

**Opened:** 2026-11-04. **Source baseline:** `70a3c287425e9276585fbff85909dcf699dcf2f2`. An audit observation must be recorded before code remediation. Findings below are **OPEN — SOURCE CONFIRMED / RUNTIME RETEST PENDING**, not silently closed.

## P8D-001 — Deployment pipeline incompatible with new production Worker entry
- **Sections / requirements:** 8D.1, 8D.8, 8D.19; `OPS-011`, `OPS-012`, `BE-001`.
- **Severity:** **P1**, release deployment blocked when using checked-in production workflow.
- **Expected:** deploy script provisions and deploys the *approved current* production Worker entry at pinned commit, including compatible migrations, after preflight and without modifying Android.
- **Actual source evidence:** `wrangler.template.jsonc` specifies `src/worker-p8b.ts` and `1.0.0-rc.1`; `.github/workflows/deploy-brick.yml` explicitly requires old `src/worker-v9.ts`, schema 15 and old branch `v1-p8-cloud-hardening`; `scripts/setup-v1-phase6.mjs` checks `src/worker-v9.ts`; `scripts/setup-v1-phase8-finalize.mjs` and `scripts/verify-cloudflare-deployment.mjs` assume old Worker/release.
- **Reproduction:** strict offline consistency test requiring the actual `main` in all production scripts to match current Wrangler template, and actual latest D1 migration to be included; this is expected to fail at baseline. A live production deploy has **NOT** been attempted.
- **Impact:** automated deployment of the current source cannot be trusted; stale Worker/schema/config may be accepted or the workflow fails before deploying.
- **Root cause hypothesis:** Phase 8B template and migrations advanced without updating the earlier production setup workflow.
- **Required correction:** align setup/deploy/verification to explicit production contract with migration preflight and non-destructive upgrade; execute dry-run and isolated D1 migration tests; only then consider an explicitly authorized live deploy.
- **Fix SHA / regression / retest:** NOT YET.
- **Status:** **OPEN**.

## P8D-002 — Backup and restore schema coverage drift
- **Sections / requirements:** 8D.8, 8D.16, 8D.17; `OPS-002`, `OPS-003`, `OPS-011`.
- **Severity:** **P1**, potential loss of required configuration/command/state on disaster restoration; actual data-loss reproduction pending.
- **Expected:** every required durable database state has explicit backup and restore or documented safe reconstruction/exclusion, and a *real isolated destructive restore* reproduces device identity/history/configuration relationships.
- **Actual source evidence:** `src/backup-v6.ts` `BACKUP_TABLES` and `src/backup-restore-v6.ts` `RESTORE_ORDER` enumerate 12 tables predating migrations 016–018; migration 016 creates live-track commands, Wi-Fi schedules, Wi-Fi results, capability profiles, screen-time daily, commutes and provider cache; 017 provider-rate windows; 018 pairing-PIN sessions. `scripts/phase8-live-brick-backup-restore.mjs` only applies the old schema through 015 in its source/target drill.
- **Required analysis:** distinguish transient/reconstructible tables (pairing PIN, rate windows, provider cache) from persistent user configurations, current commands, device capability, screen-time and commute records; test retention and restore invariants without restoring expired secrets or replaying old commands.
- **Reproduction:** compare every D1 table to explicit backup policy; fixture with non-empty current required tables; destroy only isolated fixture DB; validate restore. NOT YET RUN.
- **Required correction:** full explicit inventory and versioned restore with future schema compatibility, atomically reconciled state and destructive isolated drill.
- **Fix SHA / regression / retest:** NOT YET.
- **Status:** **OPEN**.

## P8D-003 — Public development beta authentication secret has low entropy
- **Sections / requirements:** 8D.11, 8D.14, 8D.15; `SEC-006`, `SEC-013`, `SEC-014`.
- **Severity:** **P1 provisional** if this public-template code hash is used by an Internet-reachable service with real parent/child data; **live exposure and impact NOT VERIFIED**.
- **Expected:** development backend is strictly isolated and uses sufficiently strong authentication; no reusable low-entropy parent credential-derived verifier is published as a public template constant.
- **Actual source evidence:** `wrangler.development.template.jsonc` contains `DEV_PARENT_PIN_HASH` of reusable six-digit code; `src/dev-parent-auth.ts` validates SHA-256(code), has 30-day D1 session cookie, and IP-based rate-limit. Code search does not establish whether that token is currently live.
- **Reproduction:** source-based finite code-space verification; only non-invasive live exposure test after verified domain/authorization. DO NOT brute-force any live login.
- **Required correction:** remove low-entropy published credential verifier from public source, use isolated secret-based development access and robust replay/rate-limit/session controls; rotate any potentially exposed beta code through secure out-of-band administration.
- **Fix SHA / regression / retest:** NOT YET.
- **Status:** **OPEN — live exposure unknown**.

## P8D-004 — HTTP ACK versus asynchronous R2 history durability must be formally proven
- **Sections / requirements:** 8D.5–8D.7, 8D.9; `BE-006`, `BE-007`, `BE-010`, `DAT-011`.
- **Severity:** **UNCLASSIFIED PENDING REPRO**, NOT a confirmed defect.
- **Evidence to inspect:** `src/location-ingest-v6.ts` enqueues accepted location into `EVENTS` before D1 write and returns ACK after D1/DO/safety; `src/history-store.ts` performs R2 `raw` and `trusted` puts and ACKs Queue only after both finish. Must prove all crash/order/failure boundaries, Queue→R2 contract, long-term history integrity and exactly what success ACK promises.
- **Reproduction:** Queue publish success + D1 failure, D1 success + response lost, DO failure after D1, R2 partial/duplicate/concurrent write, DLQ poison and retry expiry.
- **Status:** **AUDIT TARGET / UNKNOWN**, no P1 assigned without evidence.

## P8D-005 — Development and production authentication separation requires runtime attestation
- **Sections / requirements:** 8D.1, 8D.3, 8D.10–8D.12.
- **Severity:** **UNCLASSIFIED PENDING REPRO**, NOT confirmed defect.
- **Evidence:** production `src/access-auth.ts` validates Access RS256 JWT for parent routes, while `src/worker-v10.ts` allows D1 development sessions and strips client-supplied internal auth header. Validate the outermost Worker, deployed `APP_ENV`, routes, and cross-environment non-bypass.
- **Status:** **AUDIT TARGET / UNKNOWN**.

**Audit rule:** Fix SHA, actual reproduction run and passing retest are required to transition to `FIXED → RETESTED → VERIFIED CLOSED`. No P0/P1 exception permitted for Phase 8D PASS.
